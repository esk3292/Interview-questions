>> Null is an assignment value that we can assign to any variable that is meant to contain no value

Session storage and Local storage?
>> The data stored in session storage gets expired or deleted when a page session ends
>> Websites store some data in local machine to reduce loading time; this data does not get deleted at the end of a browsing session.

Call and Apply?

	function sayHello()
	{
	  return "Hello " + this.name;
	}   
	var obj = {name: "Sandy"};

	}       
	var person4 = {name:  "John"};

var a = 432;
var b = a;

var obj = { name: "Raj", surname: "Sharma" };
var obj2 = obj;

Strict-mode

	>> Strict mode can be defined at the start of the script with the help of the keyword ‘use strict’. 

exec () and test () methods
	exec()
		>> It is an expression method in JavaScript that is used to search a string with a specific pattern. 
		>> Once it has been found, the pattern will be returned directly, otherwise, it returns an “empty” result.
	test () 
		>> It is an expression method in JavaScript that is also used to search a string with a specific pattern or text. 
		>> Once it has been found, the pattern will return the Boolean value 'true', else it returns ‘false’. 

External JavaScript
	>> External Javascript allows web designers and developers to collaborate on HTML and javascript files.
	>> It also enables you to reuse the code.

	>> It is used to speed up the application especially in case of complex, time consuming functions. 

Recursion in a programming language
	Recursion is a technique in a programming language that is used to iterate over an operation whereas a function calls itself repeatedly until we get the result.

client-side and server-side
	Client-side JavaScript
		>> Client-side JavaScript is made up of fundamental language and predefined objects that perform JavaScript in a browser. 
		>> Also, it is automatically included in the HTML pages where the browser understands the script.
	Server-side Javascript 
		>> Server-side JavaScript is quite similar to Client-side javascript.
		>> Server-side JavaScript can be executed on a server. 
		>> The server-side JavaScript is deployed once the server processing is done.

Promises in JavaScript
	Pending
		>> It is the initial state of promise where it is in the pending state that neither is fulfilled nor Rejected
	Fulfilled
		>> has been fulfilled that assures that the async operation is done
	Rejected

	Settled
		>> where the promise is rejected or fulfilled.

		function sumOfThreeElements(...elements)
		{
		  return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
		    if(elements.length > 3 ){
		      reject("Just 3 elements or less are allowed");
		    }
		    else{
		      let sum = 0;
		      let i = 0;
		      while(i < elements.length){
		        sum += elements[i];
		        i++;
		      }
		      resolve("Sum has been calculated: "+sum);
		    }
		  })
		}

allows associating data to objects in a way that doesn't prevent the key objects from being collected, even if the values reference the keys

Temporal Dead Zone?
>> A let or const variable is said to be in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) from the start of the block until code execution reaches the line where the variable is declared and initialized

JavaScript Design patterns
	>> When we build JavaScript browser applications, there might be chances to occur errors where JavaScript approaches it in a repetitive manner. 
	>> This repetitive approach pattern is called JavaScript design patterns. 
	>> JavaScript design patterns consist of

		>> Single Ton
	Structural Design Pattern, 

	Behavioral Design patterns.

	>> We can debug in JavaScript with the help of two methods, console.log() and debugger keyword. 

pop-up boxes available in JavaScript?
	>> Pop-up boxes available in JavaScript are Alert Box, Confirm Box, and Prompt Box.

Event Capturing and Event Bubbling?
>> This process starts with capturing the event of the outermost element and then propagating it to the innermost element.
>> This process starts with capturing the event of the innermost element and then propagating it to the outermost element.


Implicit Type Coercion in javascript.
	>> Implicit type coercion in javascript is the automatic conversion of value from one data type to another.

	String coercion
		x - y
	Boolean Coercion
	Logical operators:

What do you mean by BOM?
	>> Browser Object Model is known as BOM. 
	>> It allows users to interact with the browser. A browser's initial object is a window. 
	>> As a result, you may call all of the window's functions directly or by referencing the window. 
	>> The document, history, screen, navigator, location, and other attributes are available in the window object.
